Georeferencing aerial imagery over water using only positional information

This is a work in progress, with positional_georeferencing.ipynb currently designed only to handle imagery from a Sony a6100 camera mounted in a Wingtra One Gen II drone. Requires a set of aerial photos with full metadata and a CSV flight log from the drone. Script is annotated such that it should be a straight-forward process to modify inputs for different metadata formats.
