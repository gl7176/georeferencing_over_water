# georeferencing_over_water
Georeferencing aerial imagery over water using only positional information 

This script is designed to project aerial photographs onto an estimated flat surface without any "stitching" or orthorectification. This allows imagery to be approximately geolocated in space without fixed/static features for reference. The incorporation of platform orientation (pitch, yaw, roll) makes projected locations more accurate than an assumed nadir perspective. This treatment was developed for mapping of water surfaces (e.g. sea ice, surface chlorophyll, marine wildlife) where orthorectification is not necessary and static features are generally absent, but it may also find use in cases where images lack sufficient overlap for stitchingâ€”although relief distortions will be present in landscapes with dynamic elevation.

This is a work in progress, with positional_georeferencing.ipynb currently configured to handle imagery from a Sony a6100 camera mounted in a Wingtra One Gen II drone, but it can easily be modified to handle other cameras if the metadata are accessible through the exifread package. The script requires a set of geotagged aerial photos with full positional metadata (pitch, yaw, roll) and a CSV flight log from the Wingtra with columns "time(UTC)" and "alt" (the script includes an option to use GPS altitude from exif data, but an offset will be necessary to account for the displacement of the vertical datum). The script is designed and annotated such that it should be straight-forward for a Python user to modify and troubleshoot for a new camera or platform. Familiarity with the pandas package, exif data, and rotational angles is recommended. 

I recommend that any outputs be "sanity checked" in a GIS to ensure that images closely align to their spatial context and shapefiles represent the expected flight characteristics.

Example 1: Georeferenced photos of glacial ice drifting on the sea surface. Ice movement is apparent as transects progress from lower-right to upper-left.

Example 2: Georeferenced photos of a coastal beach without orthorectification, overlaid on an orthomosaic from the same dataset.
