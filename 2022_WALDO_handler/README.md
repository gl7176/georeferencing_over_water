This folder contains a heavily adapted version of the original script, adapted to handle Waldo imagery with the IRMA csv format (https://doi.org/10.57830/2302816).

Resulting shapefiles are not exact image locations, but rather approximate locations, assuming a perfectly level aircraft, with variation by altitude and heading (which is estimated from consecutive photo locations).

Example of projected photos on top of a footprint polygon:
